COMPETENCES: At the end of this course the students will be able to make a change of scale
between a phase of development in laboratory and a production unit.
OBJECTIVES:
Provide additional training on methods of preparatory biochemistry by introducing concepts
of mass and continuous production. Confront students to solve practical theoretical and
practical problems of production, purification and analysis of natural substances and to bring
them into line with the requirements of quality, cost and safety.

#### CONTENT

Implementation of a pre-pilot scale extraction and purification process
collagen for medical use; This project will enable students to implement
technologies in the field of production, in
BPI conditions (good industrial practices). These technologies
than continuous grinding, vacuum mixing and mixing, tangential filtration
or freeze-drying will be implemented with semi-industrial equipment. This
project will also allow students to become familiar with the
quality and health safety of products and reflect on the costs of
production related to materials, reagents and personnel. Finally, they will
design the transposition of the study to the industrial scale.
