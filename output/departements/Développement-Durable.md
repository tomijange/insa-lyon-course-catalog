OBJECTIVES
The pedagogical objective of this course is to make engineering students aware of the
need to integrate ecological costs (footprints) into healthy industrial production and to give
them some evaluation tools to do so in a concrete way in their immediate environment (the
department, the campus or the town).

#### CONTENT

This program is subject to change as the course is being edited. In the first year this course
will be relatively experimental and its content will also be defined with the students. An
important part will be devoted to applied work (10 to 12 hours) on concrete and local issues (in
the department, on campus or in the urban area).
S1: Introduction and reminder of the basics of ecology (HC)
S2: IPCC Reports (HC)
S3: IPBES reports (HC)
S4: Ecosystem Services and Ecological Footprints (HC)
S5: Digital fingerprints (LL)
S6: Life cycle and responsible production: Sanofi's vision
S7: Responsible Lifecycle and Production: bioMérieux's vision
S8 to S11: TP concrete project (calculation of carbon footprint or ecological footprint
associated with an activity on campus)
S12 and S13: restitution in the form of presentations (or other deliverables)

#### AIMS

This teaching sequence, in S2, is the first part of a program that will continue throughout the
studies, with the aim of training engineers who are aware of the challenges of the ecological
transition.
In its February 26, 2020 letter of intent, INSA Lyon stated that "the courses in Sustainable
Development and Social Responsibility (SDRS) courses combine the following training
objectives :
* in terms of cross-disciplinary skills
* in terms of themes to be addressed: climate change, energy, raw materials resources, and
damage to living organisms and human health.
Two cross-cutting themes are addressed: links between science, technology and society, and
the dynamics of change.

#### CONTENT

The student-engineer will work on and be assessed on the following knowledge:
- Understanding of the main principles of the Anthropocene.
- Introduction to energy and living issues.
- Role of the engineer in the ecological transition.
The sequence will be structured as follows:
- 2h introduction ("Why talk about ecological transition in engineering schools?")
- 8h of lectures and transdisciplinary exercises on planetary limits and the Anthropocene
- 3h on biodiversity with the introduction to the One Health concept
- 5h on climate-energy issues related to IPCC works
The sequence ends with 9h on project on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and impact of the
products
IMPORTANT: 8 hours of the 28-hour course will be taught by a pair of teachers (Engineering
Sciences / Sciences and Humanities), in a "Sciences-Humas" format.

#### AIMS

"At the end of this course, students should be able to analyze engineering-related
environmental and societal issues in a systemic way:
- reformulate an engineering problem in a more global, multi-criteria vision, taking into
account all socio-technical and environmental interactions
- Develop scenarios of continuity or rupture, then arbitrate between efficiency, robustness and
goals, in a systemic approach.
- Produce a response that goes beyond the conventional (primacy of ethics over norms)
- Know how to denounce, resist, choose, demand, but also propose, create, participate in and
commit to transformation projects: be both critical and a force for proposal."

#### CONTENT

account the end-of-life of products, the rebound effects of use and the growing need for
energy and materials.
Understanding of the interdependencies between matter and energy in the light of planetary
limits.
Take a critical look at technological innovations in terms of their environmental and societal
