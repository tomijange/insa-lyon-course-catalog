Semantic Web

#### AIMS

How to formalize and exchange information and knowledge on the Web? To answer this
question, this class introduces Semantic Web which can be understood as an extension of the
classic Web by allowing to exchange et reuse data far beyond the boundaries of a Web site
or an application thanks to a "universal language". For that, the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) introduced a series of standards for representing, interrogating, exchanging and
reasoning on knowledge (data format, languages, protocoles and description logics). Although
the original and complete vision of Tim Berners-Lee (founder of the W3C) may remain utopian
for some practitioners today, a big step has already been achieved through the Web of
Data, structuring and linking  existing information on the Web (Linked data). Applications are
numerous and close to open data initiatives that flourish in many companies and territorial
collectivities.
In this context, this class aims at:
- Learn the main W3C standards on semantic Web technologies
- Be able to represent knowledge with these standards
- Be able to interrogate Web data
- Be able to use reasoning mechanisms on Web data
- Be able to develop a system using these notions along with Web services (API) to give
semantics to existing Web pages and propose a use case

#### CONTENT

In this class, you will study the theoretical foundations of Semantic Web to represent basic
information (RDF) and query knowledge bases (SPARQL). You will also see how to represent
information with richer langages (RDF-S et OWL) and a few reasoning mechanisms (RIF). This
will be done through 5 sessions of 1.5 hours each. During the unique exercice session (4 hours)
you will study in detail how to represent both formally and concretely (XML, JSON) information
and statements of the real world with RDF graphs. You will also learn how to query such
representations with the graph matching technique and will test in practice with a DBpedia
access point (where formally lie Wikipedia information). During 3 practical sessions, you will
prepare a mini-project with the following aim: adding semantics to the results of a search
engine (Google, Bing, ...). For that, you will learn how to interrogate the search engine and
inspect the HTML content: each WEB page of the results will turned into a RDF graph. You will
then be able to compare the Web pages and, for example, group pages with a similar content
with respect to their semantics and not their syntax as it is usually done in the classical Web.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

This class does not require strong prior knowledge. A plus is to have studied XML (IF-3-BDS).
It is strongly advise however to follow the class on artificial intelligence and logics (IF-4-ALIA)
during the semester.

Algorithms for artificial intelligence

#### AIMS

A first goal is to deepen some principles and practice introduced during the first semester, in
the course IF-3-ALGO : Specification of an algorithm by means of pre- and post-conditions,
Algorithm complexity, Proof of correction of an algorithm, etc.
A second goal is to study some classical algorithm coming from two (non-disjoint) domains:
Graph theory and Artificial Intelligence
Targeted skills:
- Choose relevant algorithms and data structures, and evaluate their complexity
- Master recursion and iteration
- Recognize the complexity class of a problem, and choose an appropriate solution process
with respect to this class
- Analyze a decision making problem

#### CONTENT

- Graph Algorithms: Definitions, Data structures for modelling graphs, Graph traversals,
Shortest path problems
- Planning Algorithms: Modelling a problem as the search of a plan in a state-transition graph,
Looking for optimal paths in a state-transition graph
- Introduction to computational complexity: Complexity classes, Problem reduction
- Algorithms for solving NP-hard problems: Notion of search space, Exhaustive exploration
of a search space (Branch and Bound, Minimax/alpha-beta, A*), heuristic and meta-heuristic
approaches (greedy construction, local search and simulated annealing, neural networks)
Practice through exercises, with an emphasis on the traveling salesman problem

- Be able to use reasoning mechanisms on Web data
- Be able to develop a system using these notions along with Web services (API) to give
semantics to existing Web pages and propose a use case

#### CONTENT

In this class, you will study the theoretical foundations of Semantic Web to represent basic
information (RDF) and query knowledge bases (SPARQL). You will also see how to represent
information with richer langages (RDF-S et OWL) and a few reasoning mechanisms (RIF). This
will be done through 5 sessions of 1.5 hours each. During the unique exercice session (4 hours)
you will study in detail how to represent both formally and concretely (XML, JSON) information
and statements of the real world with RDF graphs. You will also learn how to query such
representations with the graph matching technique and will test in practice with a DBpedia
access point (where formally lie Wikipedia information). During 3 practical sessions, you will
prepare a mini-project with the following aim: adding semantics to the results of a search
engine (Google, Bing, ...). For that, you will learn how to interrogate the search engine and
inspect the HTML content: each WEB page of the results will turned into a RDF graph. You will
then be able to compare the Web pages and, for example, group pages with a similar content
with respect to their semantics and not their syntax as it is usually done in the classical Web.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

This class does not require strong prior knowledge. A plus is to have studied XML (IFA-3-BDS).
It is strongly advise however to follow the class on artificial intelligence and logics (IFA-4-
ALIA) during the semester.
