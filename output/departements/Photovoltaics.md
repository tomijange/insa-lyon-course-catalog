#### AIMS

The objective is to give students the physical bases of the quantum conversion of solar
radiation to lead them to the design of a photovoltaic system, starting from the material to
the component, taking into account economic and environmental constraints.
This EC falls under the Teaching Unit MT-5-UE-SDM-S1 Materials S1 and contributes to:
School skills in science for engineers:
A1 - Analyze a real or virtual system (or problem) (Level 2)
A3 - Implement an experimental approach (Level 1)
A4 - Design a system that meets specifications (Level 2)
A6 - Communicate an analysis or a scientific approach with scenarios adapted to their
specialty (Level 1)
Specialty-specific school skills:
C1 - Know and be able to establish the Structure-Property relationships of Materials (Level 2)
C2 - Identify and implement materials development methods (Level 1)
C3 - Apply materials (Level 2)
C4 - Modeling and predicting the behavior of materials (Level 2)
By mobilizing the following skills:
A1 - Analyze a real or virtual system (or problem) (Level 2)
A2 - Use a model of a real or virtual system
