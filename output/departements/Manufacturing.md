Geometry and 3D imaging

#### AIMS

In the design phase, the engineer must master the prismatic or surface geometric definition of
the products. He must ascertain at the earliest possible feasibility of manufacture, geometric
quality and material.
This course allows us to master the various "links of the geometric digital chain" of the
mechanical products of the design to the service quality.
- To analyze manufacturing returns and to take into account the geometric quality of the real
products,
- Proficiency in 3D scanning and imaging tools for product design,
- Understand the role of non-destructive testing (NDT) methods in the life cycle of a product,
- Knowledge of advanced NDT methods such as radiography or X-ray tomography,
- Know how to analyze reconstructed images in 3D.

MANUFACTURING AND INOVATIVE PROCESS

#### AIMS

In the design phase, the BE engineer must master the prismatic or surface geometric
definition of the products. He must ascertain at the earliest possible feasibility of manufacture,
geometric quality.
This course allows us to master the various -links of the geometric digital chain- of the
mechanical products of the BE to the service quality. The mastery of the geometric definition
for the manufacture and in order to guarantee the functionalities required,
- Know the modern means of production and their possibilities of realization by mastering the
cost and the quality,
- To analyze manufacturing returns and to take into account the geometric quality of the real
products,

#### CONTENT

1) TOLERANCING ISO GPS and 3D GEOMETRIC SIMULATION (4h of course + 4h of TD + 8h
Project) - Stéphane RAYNAUD and Valerie WOLFF
- Definition of the  TOLERANCE of the products from a functional analysis
- Placement of tolerances on the 3D model using the FTA tool
- Modeling of MIPs or links on the 3D model with the 3DCS tool,
- Definition of functional conditions (play, flush, alignment, ..., between geometric elements of
3D components)
- Simulation of manufacturing and assembly of product systems
- Development of tolerance values, specification capabilities, link games, design or query
semantics.
- Consideration of component deformation in 3DCS ""compliant modler"" and using Abaqus for
CATIA
- Optimization of tolerance and control and semi-rigid or very flexible parts.
2) FAO 3AXES / 5 AXES / NX CAM or ESPRIT (4h class 6h TD / TP) - Thibaut CHAISE and
Nicolas TARDIF
-The digital chain, from CAD to the actual part
- Technology
- Functional bases of a Digital Drive/NC and CAD/CAM software
- Manufacturing range and manufacturing preparation using CAM tools
- Simulation of manufacturing from 3 to 5 axes
- Manufacturing tuning and adjustments
- Product realizations
3) INDUSTRIAL QUALITY SURVEY (4h TP) - Stéphane RAYNAUD
- Implementation of conventional metrology resources for dimensional, geometric control.
- Realization of 3D control for the optimization of manufacturing
- Roughness Control
Different quality surveys will be carried out for the development of manufacturing and the
control of dispersions or capabilities of manufacturing processes
