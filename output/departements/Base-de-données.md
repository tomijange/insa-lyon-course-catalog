Data Processing

#### AIMS

"The main aim of EC DATA is to introduce students to the handling of scientific and technical
data. The data concerned may be of various kinds (quantitative or categorical, localized or not,
one-dimensional or multidimensional, images, signals, etc.), of various types (experimental,
digital, from the field) and of various origins (other CEs in the curriculum, research labs,
industrial partners). The aim is to put the student in the position of an engineer who is
confronted with a data set and has to extract useful information and knowledge from it. The
aim is to provide students with the theoretical (probability and statistics, signal processing
methods, learning methods) and practical (text editor, spreadsheet, programming language)
tools they need to deal with a wide variety of such situations, with increasing levels of
autonomy. On completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Store and organize data for retrieval, retention, easy access and management on a
computer.
2. Read any type of file containing binary or ASCII data (.txt, .data, .csv, .h5, .toto, etc.).
3. Identify the type of data (quantitative/categorical, localized or not, mono/multi-
dimensional), their quality (abundant/limited) from the description of their origin and means of
obtaining them (experimental/numerical/field).
4. Visualize and graph a series of data by selecting the right representation and visualization
tool.
5. Process one-dimensional data to analyze a problem, applying theoretical tools in
probability, statistics and signal processing.
6. Perform basic operations on higher-dimensional data, such as segmentation and filtering.
7. Fit a model on data by linear regression using the least-squares method, using different
tools (spreadsheet, code).
8. Apply supervised or unsupervised learning methods (Principal Component Analysis,
classification) in guided cases on high-dimensional data to extract information."

#### CONTENT

1. General information on data. (Why and how to process data? Data
types, loading and saving data, graphical representations, common tools).
2. Basics of probability and statistics (random variables, CDF and PDF, descriptive statistics,
common laws, statistical moments).                               3. One-dimensional data (time, space
or other: basic operations, interpolation, regression, differential operations, signal processing,
spectral analysis, Fourier series and Discrete Fourier Transform).                            ¿4. Higher-
dimensional data (2D, 3D, 1D+time, 2D+time, etc.). basic operations, segmentation, filtering,
etc.).                                                             5. Basics of supervised and unsupervised machine
learning techniques.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

Programming basics, Scientific undergraduate mathematics.
