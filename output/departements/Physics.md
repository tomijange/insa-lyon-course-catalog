Mechanics and Electricity 1

#### AIMS

To gain an understanding and to master a lasting knowledge in different areas of Physics
(Geometric Optics, Metrology, Electricity), thanks to reflection and to critical mind. This
comprehensive knowledge is essential to take the 2nd year courses and to an engineer
education.
To develop a scientific approach to solve theoretical and experimental problems, by
implementing a multiple stage approach (observation, questioning, analysis of the problem,
experimentation, modelling, interpretation, critical analysis...).
The main skills aimed by this teaching are:
C11 - To split up a problem or a system into its component parts in interaction; C13 - To model
a system or a problem by convenient dimensions or objects in relation; C14 - To build a
scheme of the system or the problem; C16 - To build a proof; C21 - To compute by graphical
resolution an exact or approximate solution; C24 - To implement strategies to verify results
coming from modelization; C32 - To acquire experimental data by identifying and evaluating
acquisition limits; C51 - To select and implement well-adapted tools to represent and analyze
data; C54 - To interpret data in the context of a model

#### CONTENT

- Introduction to the scientific approach
- Measurements and uncertainties
- Introduction to energy
- Electricity in continuous and transient regimes
- Mechanics: statics of the solid and kinematics

#### BIBLIOGRAPHY

All physics books written for first undergraduate cycle.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

Notions learnt during secondary education: calculus, plane geometry, and trigonometric
functions, calculation skills (derivatives, anti-derivatives, complex numbers, quadratic
equations, systems of linear equations, trigonometry, vectors¿), statistics (average and
standard deviation), data and functions plots.
This teaching will also use the mathematical tools and skills that will be learnt all along the
school year.

#### AIMS

To gain an understanding and to master a lasting knowledge in different areas of Physics
(Electromagnetism), thanks to reflection and to critical mind. This comprehensive knowledge is
essential to an engineer education.
To develop a scientific approach to solve theoretical and experimental problems, by
implementing a multiple stage approach (observation, questioning, analysis of the problem,
experimentation, modelling, interpretation, critical analysis...).
The main skills aimed by this teaching are:
C12 - To reduce a system or a problem by assumptions (hypothesis); C13 - To model a system
or a problem by convenient dimensions or objects in relation; C14 - To build a scheme of
the system or the problem; C16 - To build a proof; C21 - To compute by graphical resolution
an exact or approximate solution; C32 - To acquire experimental data by identifying and
evaluating acquisition limits; C51 - To select and implement well-adapted tools to represent
and analyze data; C54 - To interpret data in the context of a model

#### CONTENT

The third semester of physics is devoted to electromagnetism. A reminder of the
mathematical tools necessary to approach electromagnetic field theory is first proposed.
Then the following notions are presented: electrostatic field, static charges (capacitor),
moving charges (resistance), magnetic field, electromagnetism at interfaces, magnetic
energy (inductance), magnetic and electric moments, static and motional induction. Maxwell's
equations are revealed and explained as the course progresses. Concrete examples of the
application of electromagnetism will be offered, in particular through the study of induction
phenomena.

#### BIBLIOGRAPHY

All physics books written for first undergraduate cycle.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

This coursewill use the knowledge and know-how acquired in Mathematical and Numerical
Tools for Engineers during the first year (see the corresponding sheets).
All the notions of physics covered in S1 and S2 of the first year will be considered as acquired
(including: geometrical optics, dimensions, uncertainties, DC and AC electricity, mechanics,
electrical and magnetic forces).

Physics : mechanical and electromagnetic waves

#### AIMS

To gain an understanding and to master a lasting knowledge in different areas of Physics
(waves in infinite and finite media, interferences), thanks to reflection and to critical mind. This
comprehensive knowledge is essential to an engineer education.
To develop a scientific approach to solve theoretical and experimental problems, by
implementing a multiple stage approach (observation, questioning, analysis of the problem,
experimentation, modelling, interpretation, critical analysis...).
The main skills aimed by this teaching are:
C12 - To reduce a system or a problem by assumptions (hypothesis); C13 - To model a system
or a problem by convenient dimensions or objects in relation; C14 - To build a scheme of
the system or the problem; C16 - To build a proof; C21 - To compute by graphical resolution
an exact or approximate solution; C32 - To acquire experimental data by identifying and
evaluating acquisition limits; C51 - To select and implement well-adapted tools to represent
and analyze data; C54 - To interpret data in the context of a model

#### CONTENT

The fourth semester is entirely devoted to the propagation of waves. It contains three
chapters. The first chapter concerns the propagation of waves in unlimited media with a
first part on mechanical waves and a second part on electromagnetic waves (introduction,
propagation equation, impedance, power transported). The second chapter deals with
propagation in limited media with the notions of reflection and transmission coefficients,
superposition of incident and reflected waves. The last chapter deals with interferences
(interference conditions, two-source interference, specificity of light waves).

#### BIBLIOGRAPHY

All physics books written for first undergraduate cycle.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

This course will also use the mathematical tools and skills that will be learnt all along the first
year, and of course the physics curriculum of the first 3 semesters (dimensions, uncertainties,
electricity, mechanics, electromagnetism).

#### AIMS

To gain an understanding and to master a lasting knowledge in different areas of Physics
(Electromagnetism and waves (mechanic-, acoustic- and electromagnetic- waves)), thanks
to reflection and to critical mind. This comprehensive knowledge is essential to an engineer
education.
To develop a scientific approach to solve theoretical and experimental problems, by
implementing a multiple stage approach (observation, questioning, analysis of the problem,
experimentation, modelling, interpretation, critical analysis...).
The main skills aimed by this teaching are:
C12 - To reduce a system or a problem by assumptions (hypothesis); C13 - To model a system
or a problem by convenient dimensions or objects in relation; C14 - To build a scheme of
the system or the problem; C16 - To build a proof; C21 - To compute by graphical resolution
an exact or approximate solution; C32 - To acquire experimental data by identifying and
evaluating acquisition limits; C51 - To select and implement well-adapted tools to represent
and analyze data; C54 - To interpret data in the context of a model

#### CONTENT

1- Electromagnetism :
Maxwell equations - Electrostatic + Magnetostatic.
Conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. Electric and magnetic fields in matter: dielectrics and
magnetic media.
Variable regime: Maxwell equations depending on time, approximation of the quasi-stationary
regimes, induction.
2- Waves in infinite media :
Wave introduction : plane, spherical, harmonic waves. Equation of propagation and d'Alembert
equation.
Mechanical waves : transversal waves on an infinite rope and longitudinal acoustic waves in
an infinite tube. Acoustical and mechanical impedance. Acoustic intensity.
Electromagnetic waves in uncharged media. Electromagnetic impedance. Polarisation.

#### BIBLIOGRAPHY

All physics books written for first undergraduate cycle.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

Notions learnt during secondary education: calculus, plane geometry, and trigonometric
functions, calculation skills (derivatives, anti-derivatives, complex numbers, quadratic
equations, systems of linear equations, trigonometry, vectors), statistics (average and
standard deviation), data and functions plots.
This teaching will also use the mathematical tools and skills that will be learnt all along the
first year.
