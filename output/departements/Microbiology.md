This CE contributes to the skills below (level) with associated abilities:
A1. Analyze a real or virtual system (or problem) (level 1)
- Define a transcriptional, translational unit
A3. Implement an experimental approach (level 2)
C5 Quantify, structurally characterize and purify biomolecules (level 2)
- Amplify, Extract and analyze DNA molecules
C7. Handling cell cultures, microorganisms or laboratory animals (level 2)

techniques for characterizing DNA by digestion with restriction enzymes
. implement the techniques of plasmid transformation in E. coli
. be able to compare the sequence delivered to the sequence plan provided
2) Plan functionality tests on a "part" / "device" / DNA system by integrating the different
levels influencing the function (transcription, translation, product stability). implement the
protein separation methods, use the principles and use of the methods for measuring the
fluorescence of the GFP reporter by spectrofluorimetry and / or fluorescence microscopy.
3) Apply knowledge on the composition of DNA and the concept of BiobrickTM
. identify the different signals on a DNA sequence using Serial Cloner and BLAST software,
manipulate the BiobrickTM standard
. master the assembly of genetic regulatory and routing signals (address signals) 4) Be
autonomous in basic molecular biology manipulations, limit as much as possible the impact of
these activities on the environment (individual protection systems vs biological and chemical
risk, contaminated material treatment circuit, waste treatment and limitation).

Microbiology
Structural virology and antiviral strategies

#### AIMS

OBJECTIVES:
Viruses are ubiquitous in our environment. They play an essential role in terms of health
and evolution. This teaching unit will address both the basics of viroly with some examples
of replication cycles and the most modern structural techniques with high resolution cryo-
electron microscopy and the observation of viral assemblies in virtual reality.
It will explain how these results allow the rational development of drugs targeting major
human pathogens such as the influenza virus and the human immunodeficiency virus.
In brief, the objective of this course is to show how one can tackle viral issues at the molecular
level with the aim of developing new therapeutic strategies.

#### CONTENT

- Part 1: Introduction to virology, viral replication and infectious power of viruses
- Part 2: Molecular and structural virology, helical and icosahedral assemblies
- Part 3: The use of cryo-electron microscopy and virtual reality in structural virology
- Part 4: Applications with the study of rhinovirus, influenza virus and human
immunodeficiency virus
- Part 5: Rational development of antiviral drugs and vaccines
