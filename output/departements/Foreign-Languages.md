#### AIMS

To consolidate, acquire, and enrich linguistic knowledge and skills by developing the
competences defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.
Students are divided into groups based on level, and specific linguistic objectives are
determined according to the student's level.

#### CONTENT

The course is divided into thematic modules : the students will take four modules during
the year. The themes vary and may change each year, but the modules may deal with, for
example, current events in the Anglophone world, news interviews, or business English.
In order to develop the defined learning outcomes, the course will employ language activities
that are varied (written comprehension and expression, oral comprehension and expression,
oral interaction) and complex (projects, simulations, etc.).
The activities are designed to promote maximum language exposure and the use of the target
language as a vehicle of culture and as a tool for work and communication.
The student will become more autonomous through group work and personal work.

#### CONTENT

The TANDEM modules offer linguistic and cultural exchanges between French-speaking
students and German-speaking, English-speaking and Spanish-speaking students in each of
the languages.
The INTERCOMPREHENSION module is all about learning to understand native speakers of
a Romance language different to one's own. Each student speaks their native language and
learns to understand the others.
The work ¿¿is carried out by organizing a debate around a controversial subject, by writing a
story, by presenting an element belonging to the specific culture, by playing board games ...
in short, by interacting permanently and in any form possible with other students fluent in the
different working languages.
Of course, oral comprehension is also at the heart of this course. It is a living, authentic
learning in the spirit of sharing. Everyone has something to learn and to pass on.

#### PRE-REQUISITE

FOR THE TANDEMS
For francophone students: B2 in German or English or Spanish
For anglophone students: B1 minimum in French
FOR INTERCOMPREHENSION
Must be native speaker of a romance language (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
