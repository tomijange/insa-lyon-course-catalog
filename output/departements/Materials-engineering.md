Surface Engineering

#### AIMS

"This course proposes to give to the futur engineer an insight into the different ways able to
improve the functional properties of the material surface".
Several solutions can be implemented to improve surface characteristics of a mechanical part:
either to change the material, or to modify the nature of its surface. This course concerns the
latter solution, and studies, on the one hand, the processes involved in the surface change,
and, on the other hand, presents the consequences of this surface modification regarding
part functionality. Surface modification results either from a bulk transformation (surface
treatment) or from the deposition of an other material (coating). Properties linked to materials
durability will be highlighted: resistance against wear, corrosion and oxidation.

#### CONTENT

Introduction on Coatings and Surface Treatments (CST)
CST and surface functionality (concept of Surface Engineering)  How to select ?
Treatments by structural transformation
Processes in liquid phase (Chemical, electrolytical deposition, elaboration by immersion, slurry
coating)
Conversion, diffusion, organic layers
Processes in gazeous phase (Physical and Chemical Vapour deposition), Thermal spaying,
coatings elaboration by high energy beam, cladding
