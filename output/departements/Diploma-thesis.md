#### ASSESSMENT METHOD

The evaluation of the project is
linked to the different academic
stages (initialization, defense at

report) and to the work done during
the training period (method and
project management, quality and
quantity of work, quality of the
documentation...). It is therefore
important to note that continuous
exchanges with the INSA supervisor
are necessary.

Diploma thesis
End of study internship

#### AIMS

An important part of our curriculum aims at providing knowledge and competencies on tools,
technologies and methods. The last semester is devoted to an End Study Project achieved
in enterprises or any public bodies. During this semester, students are in charge of the
management and development of their own project, from design steps (architecture of an
information system, a complex software system¿) and may lead to an implementation. The
main outcomes and skills are to be able to understand, organise and manage a real project,
being able to use and implement methods and techniques to solve a complex problem.
End Study projects are proposed by companies or public bodies. Each proposal (described in
1-2 pages and indicating precisely who will manage and guide the trainee) is validated by a
teacher of the department according to the required specialisation field. The proposal is then
precised to identify the nature and volume of work. The teacher is in charge to decide whether
the proposal can be the subject of a project of end of studies.
Contractual and administrative aspects are specified by an agreement signed by the
Department, the student and the hosting company.

#### CONTENT

Each student has to search and apply for an end study project during the first 3 months of the
5th year curriculum, either by applying for an internship proposal received and validated by
the department or by sending direct applications to companies. As far as a direct application
is concerned, the student is also in charge of initializing the validation process (sending the
proposal to the End Study Project coordinator). The End Study Project should represent at
least 85 working days. It starts with an initialization step devoted to the subject understanding
and required skillls acquisition phases before producing an initialisation document describing
precisely the project perimeter and how the work will be organised and scheduled. A mid-term
oral examination allows to validate the progress of the project and to make any adjustments
for the rest of the project Finally, the submission of a synthesis report and a public defense
are used to present the work carried out. During their internship students benefit from the
constant supervision of a teacher of the Department
